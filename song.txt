You can tell by the way
She walks that she's my girl
You can tell by the way
She talks she woos the world
You can see in her eyes
That no one is her change
She's my girl
My supergirl

And then she'd say it's OK
I got lost on the way
But I'm a super girl
And super girls don't cry
And then she'd say it's alright
I got home late last night
But I'm a super girl
And super girls just fly
And then she'd say
That nothing can go wrong
When you're in love
What can be wrong?
And then she'd laugh
The night time into day
Pushing her fear
Further alone
